Welcome and thanks for trying out Gajim.

=RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS=
python2.4 (python2.3 should work too)
pygtk2.5 or higher (NOTE: pygtk2.5 is devel so pygtk2.6 in case of problems)
python-libglade

some distros also split too much python standard library.
I know SUSE does. In such distros you also need python-xml
the xml lib that *comes* with python and not pyxml or whatever

=COMPILE-TIME REQUIREMENTS=
python-dev
python-gtk2-dev
libgtk2.0-dev		# aka. gtk2-devel
libxss-dev			# for idle detection module (Some distributions (f.e. Debian) split xscreensaver)
libgtkspell-dev	# for gtkspell module
intltool

NOTE:
if you still have problems compiling, you may want to try removing the gtk1 series of the above dependencies

Optionally:
dnspython or pydns for SRV support; if you don't know what that is, you don't need it
gtkspell and aspell-LANG where lang is your locale eg. en, fr etc
GnomePythonExtras 2.10 or above so you can avoid compiling trayicon and gtkspell

NOTE TO PACKAGERS:
Gajim is a GTK+ app and not a gnome one. Just do 'make' so you don't require gnomepythonextras
which is gnome dep

=INSTALLATION PROCEDURE=
tar jxvf gajim-version.tar.bz2
cd gajim
make	# builds all modules
su -c make install

To specify what modules to build do:
make help

To specify where to install do:
su -c make PREFIX=custom_path install

=RUNNING GAJIM=
gajim

or if you didn't 'make install' you can also run from gajim folder with
./launch.sh

Last but not least, you can run Gajim from your GNOME/XFCE/KDE/whatever menus.

=UNINSTALLATION PROCEDURE=
su -c make uninstall
this will try to remove Gajim from the default directories.
If you want to remove it from custom directory provide it as:
make PREFIX=custom_path uninstall

=MISCELLANEOUS=
XML & Debugging:
If you want to see the xml stanzas and/or help us debugging 
you're advised to enable verbose via advanced configuration window.
If you don't want to make this permanent, execute gajim with --verbose
everytime you want to have verbose output.
